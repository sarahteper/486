	<p>When thinking about communicating with extraterrestrial forms, I recognized that they should understand our planet in its simplest form: the four classical elements. Early forms of humankind had to learn to navigate Earth starting with these four elements, and I aimed to represent these ideas in somewhat abstract, geometric shapes. I also felt it necessary to include an alphabet and number system. As educated humans, we were able to decipher hieroglyphics. Therefore, assuming that this extraterrestrial species is educated, they may be able to decode the commonly used Latin alphabet. </p>
